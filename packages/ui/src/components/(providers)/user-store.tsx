 * Previously the store was a module-level singleton (`export let
 * useUserStore` in @repo/lib) lazily initialised from the request URL. On
 * the server that single instance was shared across all concurrent
 * requests, so one tenant's map state could bleed into another tenant's
 * SSR HTML — and it caused React 19 hydration mismatches. The store is now
 * created once per provider (per request on the server, per mount on the
 * client) and shared via this React context.
 *
 * These live in @repo/ui (not @repo/lib) because `createContext` is a
 * client-only API and would break Server Components that import @repo/lib.
